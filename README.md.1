This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a lightweight transformer (DistilBERT) for multi-label emotion classification from customer review text. It reflects core responsibilities expected in the Data Scientist role at MavenMagnet â€” including LLM fine-tuning, emotion detection, data preprocessing, multi-label classification, and deployment-readiness.
